### **Change log**

- Thanks to Framer adding steppers, I've updated the numeric values to also show steppers v. sliders, so it’s easier to increment or decrement the number of tabs or choose which is the active tab
- Added 2 more icon sets! [Ionicons](https://zamarrowski.github.io/react-ionicons/) and [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&s=regular&m=free])

  - For those uncertain which icons names will work check the icon library links above, and visit [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/) and [Material Icons](https://material.io/tools/icons/?style=baseline) for those existing to see a list of useable icon names

- The iOS Tab Bar labels are now responsive! (portrait and landscape)

- The home indicator is now responsive as well (portrait and landscape)

- Updated to be compatible with Framer X’s latest version
