## Overview

An SVG Path animator component. Connect the component to any Graphic element with an SVG Path, and it will automatically animate to its length, while offering a suite of animation controls. Supports multiple path animations, but in order to get the most reliable results, use the **Join** Boolean Operation to combine all paths within your Graphic Container. Happy animating!
