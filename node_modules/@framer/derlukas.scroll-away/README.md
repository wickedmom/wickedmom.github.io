# Overview

Scroll Away hides design elements on scrolling down and let's them reappear on scrolling up.

## Setup

This package comes with to code overrides, that you need to use this package. To make them available for these easy steps:

1. **Install** this package.
2. Select a Frame on the canvas, and **create a new code override file**. 
By default, the file is called App.tsx - don’t change that!
3. Now you should see „**getScrollData**” and „**useScrollData**“ available in your code overrides panel! You’re done! 🎉

**Now you can follow the steps below to get it to work.**

## Usage

1. Drag the component onto the canvas.
2. Connect to the Frame you want to use as content.
3. Apply code override „**getScrollData**" to the scroll-component.
4. Apply code override „**useScrollData**" to the ScrollAway-component.
5. You did it again! 👏


Now you can go ahead and adjust the **settings** of the **ScrollAway**-component to your needs.
